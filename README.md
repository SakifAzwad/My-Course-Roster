3 Features of this Project:

1. Course Management:
   
   i) Users can add courses to their list, and these courses are    displayed in a column.
   
   ii) A course can only be added once to prevent duplication.

2. Toast Notifications:

   i) When a user tries to add a course that they've already taken, a toast notification is shown to alert them.

   ii) Another toast notification is displayed if a user attempts to exceed the 20-credit limit.

3. Credit Limit:

   i) Implement a credit limit of 20 credits, ensuring users cannot add more courses once they reach this limit.

Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.
